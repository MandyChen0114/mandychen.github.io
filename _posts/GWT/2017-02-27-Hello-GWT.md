*Note*: All contents of this article are sorted out from [offcial document of GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/overview.html).


#### I. Overview 
According to the [offcial document of GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/overview.html):

> GWT is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. **Its goal is to enable productive development of high-performance web applications without the developer having to be an expert in browser quirks, XMLHttpRequest, and JavaScript**. GWT is used by many products at Google, including AdWords, AdSense, Flights, Hotel Finder, Offers, Wallet, Blogger. It’s open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.

You’ll see at least two packages:

  + **Client package**: code that will eventually be compiled to JavaScript and run as client code in the browser.   
  + **Server package**: The java files in it will be run as Java bytecode on a server


#### II. Project Components 

##### 1. The module XML file

In order to compile, a GWT module must specify an entry point. If a GWT module has no entry point, then it can only be inherited by other modules. It has the structure like:

##### 2. The Host Page

The code for a web application executes within an HTML document, which is the host page. The host page references the application style sheet and the path of JavaScript source code (generated by GWT) responsible for the dynamic elements on the page.

##### 3. The Application Style Sheet

Any web page can be specified multiple style sheets. List multiple style sheets in their order of inheritance; that is, **with the most specific style rules in the last style sheet listed**.

##### 4. The Java source code

It is a Java class that implements the GWT interface EntryPoint. It contains the method onModuleLoad which will be called once our webApp is launched.


#### III. Work flow 

1. Examining the functional requirements
2. Identifying the elements of the UI design
3. Select the GWT widget in [Widget Gallery](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/RefWidgetGallery.html) for UI elements
4. Selecting GWT panels to lay out the UI elements 
5. Embedding the application in the host page
6. Implementing widgets and panels 
7. Manage Events
8. Debugging
9. Compilation


#### IV. AJAX Communication 

Each time traditional web applications talk to the web server, they fetch a completely new HTML page. In contrast, **AJAX applications offload the user interface logic to the client and make asynchronous calls to the server to send and receive only the data itself**. This allows the UI of an AJAX application to be much more responsive and fluid while reducing an application’s bandwidth requirements and the load on the server.

##### Implementation Strategy

###### Making Remote Procedure Calls (GWT RPC)
GWT RPC is a mechanism for passing Java objects to and from a server over standard HTTP. The server-side code that gets invoked from the client is often referred to as a **service**.  

When setting up GWT RPC, you will focus on these three elements involved in calling procedures running on remote servers.

  + the service that runs on the server (the method you are calling)
  + the client code that invokes the service
  + the Java data objects that pass between the client and server

###### Retrieving JSON Data via HTTP

Make a call to your local server to retrieve JSON-formatted data:

  + Creating a source of JSON data on your local server
  + Manipulating JSON data in the client-side code
  + Making HTTP requests to retrieve data from the server
  + Handling GET errors

###### Making Cross-Site Requests for JSONP

Make a call to a remote server to retrieve JSON-formatted data. The steps for this strategy are similar to those of previous session, but we have two issues to address:

**1 | Access Restrictions to *Client-Side Code*: SOP (Same Origin Policy)**  
The Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a browser security measure that restricts client-side JavaScript code from interacting with resources not originating from the same domain name, protocol and port.

The idea behind SOP is that, for security reasons, the browser should not trust content loaded from arbitrary websites. A malicious web page could inject code that steals data or otherwise compromises security.

There are two options for working around SOP security:

  + **Proxy on your own server**: You can then make HTTP calls to your local server and have it go fetch the data from the remote server. 

  + **Load the JSON response into a `<script>` tag**

**2 | Asynchronous Communication: JSONP**  
The web server will then wrap the JSON response in a call to that function.
